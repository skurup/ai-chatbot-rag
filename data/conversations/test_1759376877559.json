However, in general terms, artificial intelligence refers to the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. These processes include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding. AI is used in various applications such as speech recognition, natural language processing, image recognition, and decision-making. For more detailed information on AI, you may refer to reliable sources like academic publications or reputable websites on AI and machine learning.",
