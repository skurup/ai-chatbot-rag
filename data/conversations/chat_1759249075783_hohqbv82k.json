      "content": "The concept of micro-partitions is fundamental to how Snowflake organizes and stores data efficiently. In Snowflake, data is stored in micro-partitions which are immutable, automatically compressed sets of files. These micro-partitions are typically 50-500 MB in size and contain a portion of the table's data. When a table is queried, Snowflake's query processing engine optimizes performance by reading only the relevant micro-partitions, leading to faster query execution times. Additionally, as new data is loaded or existing data is modified, Snowflake can efficiently manage these changes by creating new micro-partitions, enabling time-travel queries and ensuring data consistency and reliability.
