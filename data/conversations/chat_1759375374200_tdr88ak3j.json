These optimizations aim to improve query performance by considering factors like the overall size of tables being queried, the impact of query complexity and data sets, and the number of joins/tables in the query. By applying these optimizations, users can enhance query efficiency and warehouse load management within the Snowflake platform.

This optimization process aims to enhance query performance by leveraging the Snowflake platform features such as data governance, allowing for the efficient execution of queries on both standard and hybrid tables. Additionally, Snowflake enables users to run hybrid workloads that mix operational and analytical queries seamlessly, join hybrid tables with other Snowflake tables efficiently, and execute atomic transactions across hybrid tables and other Snowflake tables without the need for manual coordination [Source: Hybrid tables | Snowflake Documentation].",
