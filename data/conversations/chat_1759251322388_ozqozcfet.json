      "content": "Snowflake achieves data pruning by utilizing metadata and the organization of data within micro-partitions. When a query is executed, Snowflake's query optimizer uses metadata about the table's data distribution and statistics to determine which micro-partitions contain relevant data for the query. By leveraging this metadata and the organization of data within micro-partitions, Snowflake can efficiently skip irrelevant micro-partitions during query processing, reducing the amount of data that needs to be scanned. This approach helps improve query performance by minimizing the amount of data that needs to be processed.

      "content": "In Snowflake, the organization, file size, structure, compression, metadata, statistics, and other aspects of data storage are handled by Snowflake itself. The actual data objects stored by Snowflake are not directly visible nor accessible by customers; they are only accessible through SQL query operations run using Snowflake Query Processing. Snowflake stores metadata separately from the actual data, and this metadata includes information about the structure, distribution, and statistics of the data. The metadata is used by Snowflake's query optimizer to efficiently process queries and perform tasks like data pruning. The actual data is stored in micro-partitions within Snowflake's architecture, which are units of storage that contain ranges of values for one or more columns. This separation of metadata and actual data storage allows Snowflake to provide efficient query processing and data management capabilities.

      "content": "Clustering in the context of Snowflake refers to specifying a clustering key for a table to optimize query performance. When you cluster a table in Snowflake, you define the order in which data is physically stored on disk based on one or more columns. This arrangement can improve query performance, especially when the order of data storage matches the common query patterns. By specifying a clustering key, you can reduce the amount of data that needs to be scanned during queries, leading to faster query execution times. Clustering is particularly beneficial for large datasets and can help improve performance when queries filter or join on the clustered columns.
