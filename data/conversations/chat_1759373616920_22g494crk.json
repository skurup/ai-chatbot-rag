      "content": "Optimizing a query involves various techniques to improve its performance. In Snowflake, one approach is to create a multi-column clustering key for tables that are frequently queried based on specific columns. This can enhance performance by reducing the amount of data scanned during queries that filter on those columns [Source: Table Design Considerations | Snowflake Documentation]. Additionally, monitoring query activity with tools like Query History can help identify problematic queries that may benefit from optimization. Analyzing parameters like total time or resources consumed by grouped or parameterized queries can highlight areas needing improvement [Source: Monitor query activity with Query History | Snowflake Documentation].",
